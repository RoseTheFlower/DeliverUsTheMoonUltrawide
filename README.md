## Deliver Us The Moon Ultrawide and FOV fixes
![](preview.jpg)

Two tools made to address the field of view and black bars issues affecting 21:9 and wider displays.
* The small patcher is intended for ultrawide monitors.
* The trainer also allows to modify the field of view in real time and supports the Microsoft Store / Game Pass version of the game.

If using the trainer, make sure the game is already running.

Tested the tools on the latest GOG version at 2560x1080 and 7680x1080.
